  # only needed to support those cases.

  # the interpreter you're using - Appveyor does not do anything special
  # to put the Python version you want to use on PATH.

  # This step builds your wheels.
  # Again, you only need build.cmd if you're building C extensions for
  # 64-bit Python 3.3/3.4. And you need to use %PYTHON% to get the correct

#  access your wheels from the Appveyor "artifacts" tab for your build.
